    <div class="intro">
    <br><p>Euthanasia has attracted a lot of controversy over the years.
        In 2020, New Zealand put out a referendum on whether we should legalize euthanasia in New Zealand, resulting in euthanasia being legal in New Zealand. 
        Today, the number of countries that allow euthanasia is growing. 
        But what exactly is euthanasia, and how are your Christian viewpoints affected? 
        This website covers the application of the key ethical principles of the Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) Church to the issue of Euthanasia. 
        This will be accomplished by explaining <a href="about.html">what euthanasia is about</a>, <a href="relation.html">what the SDA Church has to say about this issue</a>, and the <a href="implications.html">wider implications SDA principles have</a>.</p>

        <a href="implications.html"><h2>Some implications of Euthanasia</h2></a>
    <p>An implication is a conclusion that can be drawn from something although it is not explicitly stated.
    <br>This page would cover the implications Euthanasia has on the <a href="implications.html#political">political</a> sphere of our world today, as well as its meaning to me <a href="implication.html#personal">personally</a>.

    <div class="end">
    <p>Euthanasia is the action of ending another person’s life because it has been considered that they would be better dead. 
        Another term we learned was assisted dying, which is a form of euthanasia, except the final act is made by the patient themselves. 
        Losing a loved one hurts bad, and it’s harder to watch them suffer in pain. But we have been shown from the bible euthanasia is wrong, 
        because it goes against the principle of the fifth commandment, thou shalt not kill. The bible also has principles such as Christian love that 
        tells us how to respond to the dying. When all we can see is a majority of people, or our own feelings contradicting our beliefs, is when the 
        principles God gave to us would be hard to follow. But in these times, it’s important to hold on to the promises God gave to those who will follow his word.
