            <h2>What is Euthanasia?</h2>
            <p>Euthanasia is when a person is killed intentionally if the person is considered better off dead. 
                This would be because of an incurable disease that gives the person a lot of pain or if the person is in an irreversible coma. (Oxford Languages, n.d.) 
                Another term closely related to and in some areas used interchangeably with euthanasia is assisted suicide. 
                I thought it would be helpful to include this term because while researching I often found this term mentioned next to euthanasia. 
                It also has to do with the choice of taking a life in the same situations as euthanasia. 
                The difference between the two is mainly found in who is doing the killing. 
                With assisted suicide, the patient is given the means to die, but it is the patient who decides to do the act. 
                (thatswhytv, 2020) Assisted Dying is a general name used where both terms fall into.

            <h2>History of Euthanasia</h2>
            <p>Hippocrates, a Greek physician from 460 B.C., is the creator behind the Hippocratic oath, 
                which makes doctors swear, “I will not give a lethal drug to anyone if I am asked, nor will I advise such a plan.” 
                Before this, however, euthanasia was conducted by doctors without having to consult or ask permission from anyone else. 
                With no rules like the Hippocratic oath, corrupt doctors were licensed to kill patients for selfish reasons, 
                and not in service to the patients' health. (GARG, 2020) During the 12th to 15th century, 
                the Christian faith has grown stronger, and so did the Christian view that humans are given life from God, 
                and we are made in his image therefore human lives are valuable and whether a person’s life 
                is still valuable enough to be kept alive is not our decision to make. They reinforced the Hippocratic oath, 
                and around that time almost all medical minds agreed. (procon.org, 2022) From the 17th to 19th century, 
                euthanasia and assisted suicide were outlawed in more countries, with the church still very involved. 
                It appears debates on euthanasia and assisted suicide have been around since ancient Greece and Rome, 
                but a turning point for the euthanasia debate happened in the 1870s when morphine, a drug from the opiate family 
                used to relieve pain, received a lot of attention, and was first advocated by a man named Samuel Williams 
                to be used not just to relieve pain but to be used in euthanasia as well. (Emanuel, 1994) 
                Even though Samuel was no physician, his nomination was heavily discussed within medical meetings and journals. 
                Still, most physicians disagreed with euthanasia being legal. Many saw legalizing euthanasia as an attempt to make physicians executioners, 
                loosely quoting what the Journal of the Medical Association wrote in response to the proposal. 
                In 2020, the New Zealand government legalized euthanasia, and made available in November 2021. 
                Netherlands was the first country to legalize euthanasia in 2002. However, it was Switzerland who first passed a bill of assisted suicide. 
                According to The Week as of September 2021, eleven countries so far have legalized euthanasia, 
                each with different regulations. Earlier that year around March, it had been legal in just seven countries. 
                This shows the growing number of countries willing to legalize euthanasia, though usually under strict regulations.

            <h2>Methods of Euthanasia</h2>
            <p>The terms used in relation to euthanasia and their meanings are different around the world. 
                An example of this variation can be found in Annals of Palliative Medicine website, 
                which has provided a table of the countries who’ve legalized euthanasia as of March 2021 attached to a euthanasia article. (Mroz et al., n.d.) 
                There are two main types of Euthanasia which seems to be agreed upon: Active and Passive. 
                Active euthanasia, sometimes called aggressive euthanasia, is administering a lethal dose of a drug to a patient. 
                There has been debate about what drug should be used for active euthanasia, but the drugs most used are those in a group called barbiturates. 
                They’re used to treat insomnia, seizure disorders, or as anesthesia. Over time they are used recreationally. 
                When OD’d, barbiturates cause the brain to slow down so much that it eventually stops giving commands 
                to the patient’s involuntary functions such as breathing, and so the patient dies. 
                Passive euthanasia is killing the patient not by performing something but rather by not performing something for example, 
                removing any life support. Examples of this are putting the patient off dialysis, 
                ceasing to give them medication that regulates the patient, performing any operation to lengthen the patient’s life, etc. 
                There are some who argue that assisted dying is not separate from euthanasia but a separate type of euthanasia 
                because the patient is still helped by the attending physician, just like active and passive euthanasia. 
                However, it cannot be passive because they are providing a lethal dose, and it cannot be active 
                because under that would mean the physician is the one putting the poison into the patient’s system. 
                Therefore, it falls into its own category under euthanasia. (thatswhytv, 2020)
