        <div class="intro">
            <br>
            <p>Death is caused by sin, and is part of the human condition. (Genesis 2:17;Romans 5; Hebrews 9:27). 
                As Christians wait for Jesus to come, here on Earth, God wants us to care for those who are dying. (Adventist.org, n.d.)
                Today, modern medicine makes decisions on how to care for the dying harder to make. Moral and ethical questions like: 
                Does the Christian faith put any constraints on the power to postpone death, alleviate pain at the near point of death, 
                or actions made to end human suffering?; Are there any limits Christian love should place on these actions?’, are harder to answer.
                SDA believe that ‘pulling the plug’ on treatments that prevent death is a morally different action than administering medicine with its main purpose to end a life.
                God created the gift of human life with wonder, worthy of being sustained and protected (Genesis 1-2). They also believe in redemption, 
                as God also redeemed those who believe in him by giving them eternal life (John 3:15). This is why the SDA faith supports treatments 
                that are there to prolong life on earth. Hand in hand with this, we should also use this ability only to minimize suffering. 
                Christians believe and look forward to the return of Christ and his gift of eternal life, and so Christians don’t 
                have to be afraid of death or cling to life.
                Bible-based principles SDA supply are as follows.
                </p><br>
        </div>
        
        <div id="right_to_know" class="text1">
            <h2>Dying people have right to know they are dying</h2>
            <p>People who are close to their deaths have the right to know. They should also be given all the options they can make in response to this. 
                This is linked to the principle of speaking the truth (Ephesians 4:15). The truth shouldn’t be withheld, and Ephesians tells us 
                that it should also be shared with love, and SDA believe this includes being caring and sensitive to the person’s own values.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="free_will" class="text2">
            <h2>God has given humans free will</h2>
            <p>Another principle that guides how the SDA respond to the topic of euthanasia is the principle that all humans have been given free will from God. 
                They believe this principle applies to the topic of medical care, like whether or not the person wants to accept treatment for their condition. 
                Romans 14:7 also reminds us that we are also alive for someone else, not just for us. We are connected to many lives and we do belong to God, 
                so it’s important for us to turn to God’s word first for guidance and then medical advice. After all consideration, ultimately the choice 
                is up to us and if we were in the shoes of a terminally ill person, we shouldn’t be forced into any treatment we don’t want to undergo.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="not_alone" class="text3">
            <h2>Man should not be alone</h2>
            <p>SDA value the principle that man should not be alone. (Genesis 2:18) God wants his people to thrive with each other and have healthy relationships. 
                After hearing a medical perspective, the patient can talk about important decisions to be made about treatment for them within their families or 
                family relationships. Building on this principle, SDA support giving decision making to someone the patient trusts and has chosen if the patient 
                is in a state which makes them unable to decide. If this hasn’t been done, SDA suggest that the power to decide for 
                the patient goes to someone close to that person. Before any complication can happen, is best for the patient to write
                their wishes on how they want their medical treatment down officially while they are still able.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="christian_love" class="text4">
            <h2>Christian love is practical and responsible</h2>
            <p>SDA believe that Christian love is practical and responsible (Romans 13:8-10, 1 Corinthians 13, James 2:14-17). Faith can move mountains, 
                and this principle doesn’t deny that. Keeping this principle in mind we don’t have to accept treatment that may be there to help, 
                but its burdens outweigh the benefits. An example of this would be if a patient is given treatment that only sustains their organs and keeps them 
                alive to lay down on a bed forever. This is vain, and with a good heart, can be stopped. This also applies to treatment that avoids the person’s 
                soon inevitable death and gives them pain. This is also vain and unnecessary. Christians should keep in mind that human life is from God, and should 
                be treated as such, so decisions they make about the dying should be in harmony with this principle.<br>
                SDA do not condone actions that intentionally take the life of a human being, like assisted suicide and euthanasia (Exodus 20:13, Genesis 9:5-6).
                They do condone actions that relieve pain and suffering as much as possible, and opt for this when no medical treatment can cure the patient. 
                This is in line with the principle of alleviation of suffering under Christian compassion (Matthew 25:34-40, Luke 10:29-37).
                </p>
        </div>
        <div id="justice" class="text5">
            <h2>God loves justice</h2>
            <p>Another principle SDA builds on is the principle of justice. In the context of caring for the dying. They are part of the defenseless and dependent, 
                and extra care should be provided for them with respect, because they still have their dignity, and without discrimination (Psalm 82:3- 4, Proverbs 24:11-12, Isaiah 1:17, Micah 6:8, ). 
                Their worth is not dictated by how others perceive them, and others' perception of a dying person’s worth should not dictate how they are cared for (James 2:1-9). Their care should be based 
                on their spiritual needs, medical needs, and their own choices.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="prayer" class="text6">
            <h2>There is power in prayer</h2>
            <p>SDA believe in the power of prayer, that God hears his children’s prayers and has the power to work miracles for them (Psalm 103:1-5; James 5:13-16). 
                Along with this, Christians should also put trust in God’s will and accept what God gives them, because they know that God only gives them good things (Matthew 26:39). 
                This is in accordance to how Jesus prayed to his Father. They also believe that God’s grace is sufficient to overcome adversities (Psalm 50:14-15)(2 Corinthians 12:9).
