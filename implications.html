            <h2>Political Implications</h2>
            <p>So how would applying these principles look like in the real world? Say you’re a political leader, who is also a devoted Seventh-Day Adventist. 
                What would you do when you are given a paper to sign that would legalize euthanasia, the very thing you believe is wrong? 
                An experiment taken in 2003 assessing how terminally ill cancer patients’ death from euthanasia affects the grief response of bereaved family and 
                friends verses those who lost a loved one due to cancer running its’ course between the years 1992 and 1999. This resulted in the family and 
                friends feeling less grief, having less traumatic grief symptoms and less PTSR than the family and friends of cancer patients who died of cancer. (Swarte, n.d.) 
                From these statistics, euthanasia seemed to be having a good impact on families of the deceased patient. On the other hand, 
                (aside from reasoning from the bible,) according to Care, legalising euthanasia could lead on to doctors using the law and finding a way for them to end 
                the patient’s life on their own decision. They made an example of statistics from the Netherlands, where both euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal. 
                Not all doctors reported when their patients were euthanized, and in 1990 around 1000 patients were killed involuntarily. (Care, n.d.) 
                Care also thinks about how legalizing euthanasia would affect those dependent on others such as family and vulnerable. 
                Telling them they have the ‘right to die’ could also indirectly tell them that they have a ‘duty to die’, making them feel like a burden, 
                and cause them to take their own life. Sounds familiar.

            <h2>Personal Implications</h2>
            <p>Personally, I would feel something pushing me to do the right thing, and not sign the paper. Although it is easier said than done, I
                trust that God will stay with me through the consequences. The comfort Christians have while following bible principles about caring for the dying 
                is the promise that this suffering is not just fleeting, it will be turned into joy.
